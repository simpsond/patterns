# Patterns

Just because someone posts code to GitHub doesn't mean it's good, and that applies here. The work in this repository is me getting back into hobby Amiga development while participating in an [Amiga Tool Jam](https://itch.io/jam/amigatooljam).

The code within is very rough, poorly organized and has only been tested to compile on VBCC. I welcome any constructive feedback.
