MUI was developed using C and thats why C is probably the best choice
when programming MUI applications.

This drawer contains some include files and examples as well as a stub
library for MUI's tag item functions when using DICE.

MUI should work with SAS-C 6.2 or higher and DICE without
problems, other compilers might need slight modifications.

Much success, Stefan.
