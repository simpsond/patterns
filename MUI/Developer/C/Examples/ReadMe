This directory contains the source codes for the supplied
demo programs. It should compile under SAS and DICE.

Furthermore, the complete source code for the public
screen manager PSI is included for eduational purpose.
Sorry to DICE users, PSI only compiles under SAS.

Don't miss the little brush2c goodie which can be used
to include ILBM brushes in MUI programs.

Note: You will need at least 2.0 (v37.175) include files
      and linker libraries!

Much success with your own MUI applications!
