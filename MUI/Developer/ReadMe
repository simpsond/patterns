                         - Developer Archive -



This  archive  contains  all  developer  material  available for the MUI
system.  You  will  find  detailed  programmer  documentation  in Ascii,
AmigaGuide(tm)  or  DVI  format, per class autodoc files, interfaces for
different  languages and the complete documented source code for all the
demonstration programs from the user archive.

Starting with release 3.5, the Oberon, Modula and Amiga-E interfaces are
no longer included in the developer archive. Please find them separately
on Aminet in drawer dev/mui.

Please read the text files in the Docs drawer of this distribution. They
will  hopefully  explain  all important topics about using MUI with your
own applications.

All  the  files  coming  with  the  MUI  developer  archive are provided
"AS-IS";  no  warranties  are  made.  All  use  is  at your own risk. No
liability or responsibility is assumed.

The  complete  and  unmodified MUI developer archive, as provided by the
author,  may  be  freely redistributed via any means which preserves its
copyrights. The archive may not be sold for profit.
